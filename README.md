# Coursera-Data-Science-Project

This project belongs to Coursera Data Science Project Program.
We're given 3 datasets:
  1. train data
  2. test data
  3. description of columns
Task is to predict whether the given individual is loan defaulter or not.
I used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, RandomForest and KNN algorithms.
RandomForest performed better, hence i proceeded with this one.

Thanks.
Awaiting guidance and feedback.
